book 8

Alice is super cute, it will be my next Starbuck name!

我小时候就买了这本书，那还是书虫系列的时候，绿色的，在姚正街我的小房间里开空调，暑假的下午，但每次一读到alice take a nap，我自己就take a nap 了....

小时候觉得奇奇怪怪的，但现在觉得可可爱爱！就有可以自己interpret 的道理 （ So long as I get somewhere.  If only you walk long enough），然后又偶尔很搞笑 (a dreadful person, but a quite handsome pig). hahahahaha _!

还有rap 的demo, Lobster Quadrille Dance Crew.
真的是好潮，嘻哈街舞样样有。

这本书就是all directional, 读者可以觉得他什么都没写，也可以理解为什么的写了。

怎么behave :Keep you temper.

怎么追梦： That depends a good deal on where you want to get to."
"I don't much care where –"
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go."

戒掉拖延： procrastination cure: "Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”

不愧是mathematician 写的， 就还有prove by contradiction.

a-> b  doesn't imply b->a, necessary but not sufficient.

i mean what i said, I said what I mean.

I eat what i see, i see what I eat.

I breathe when I sleep, I sleep when I breathe...

最有同感的句子！好接地气！ 哈哈... 原来大作家也一样

She generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom follow it.

Key take away: 好好练字！

Alice 喝了药水才有后面的故事，她为什么喝药水呢？
因为瓶子上的花体字好看！！！

the bottle was a paper label with the words "DRINK ME" Beautifully printed on it in cursive letter.

还有 一凡的 ”做大做强“， Alice 长高了就不怕那个天天喊打喊杀的皇后了 

Happy Reading！
